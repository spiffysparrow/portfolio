            Three roommates try to deal with a paper crane infestation.
            <p>
            I love origami &mdash; I’m one of those people who trails tiny paper cranes wherever they go. When I started thinking about what to do my movie on, I was struck by how I gradually infest the places I live with these tiny creatures.
            </p><p>
            I made this movie for an unofficial film class I took a few semesters ago. My friends had recently gone through a flea infestation and I was inspired by the helplessness of a bunch of girls trying to deal with pests.

            A girl gets snatched by water sprites.</p>
            <p>This was the first animation project I ever did. It was a pretty steep learning curve, and far too ambitious a project to start out with. But even though it was a lot of work and I had to cut it down some, I’m still really happy with how it came out. It got a national gold metal from the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.</p>

            An old Irish myth in an urban setting.</p><p>
            This was for a ceramics class. The assignment was to do a project with unfired clay. So everything you see is real, ceramic quality clay, (which is coincidentally horrible for Claymation, but the concept of real clay was important to my teacher).</p>
            <p>
We were supposed to tap into the meaning of unfired clay, and I decided the important factor was that it was malleable and could transform. Originally I just planned to have a girl slowly wash away into the ocean, but it kept growing from that, into more of a story.
