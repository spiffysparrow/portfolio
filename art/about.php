<p>I’m a recent UT graduate with a degree in studio art. All my life I’ve been obsessed with art, I have the pages and pages of horrible fairy sketches to prove it. </p><p>
Despite my traditional art training, you’ll notice there is a serious doodle focus to this site. That’s because I believe in doodles in a deep, life altering way. There’s something about the unplanned freedom of it that takes art in more bizarre and interesting directions that sitting down to try to create serious art. I often incorporate doodles into other aspects of my art, you can see with my animation “Couch Potato” which is pretty much a collage of a bunch of my doodles brought to life. </p><p>
Check out the rest of my website to see some of my varied interests, from painting, to animation, to programing.
